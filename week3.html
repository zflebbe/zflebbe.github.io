The fact that foreign words are superimposed by text from a recognized language is extremely powerful and effective.<br>
If this technology were to be adapted to run on a on a pair of AR glasses or contact lenses, the world could be changed immensely. Potentially, a user wearing a pair of AR glasses in a foreign country would gain the ability to navigate that country with relative ease. As with most concepts, this ability would undoubtedly come with pros and cons.<br>
Pros: There are many pros that this technology could offer an individual. For example, a potential user in a foreign country would be able to read signs for various shops, informational pamphlets, and locations while avoiding the entire process of asking native citizens for assistance.
