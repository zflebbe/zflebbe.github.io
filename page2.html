<h2>CS 491 Demo Reflections</h2>
<p>Common Smart Phone/Tablet AR
The common smart phone it most widely available augmented reality devices. In the past few years the level of technology has been increasing exponentially with the number of available apps skyrocketing. Nearly everyone has a smart phone, thus apps are portable and readily available, allowing a user to experience the app nearly anywhere. When using the app Spacecraft 3D, I immediately noticed how well the augmented spaceship responded to the papers rotation. One of these technologies limitations is the quality of the camera. There is a vast difference between the camera qualities of an iPhone X compared the iPhone 6.
	 
HoloLens
The HoloLens is limited to Automated Reality. With the use of a slim, eye covering headset the user is able to interact with items within his actual field of vision. This allows for an immersive experience within the area which it is being used. The HoloLens does not support the use of controllers, rather relying on hand gestures for interaction. While this does free up the users’ hands, I feel it is less precise than some of the other options. This device does not impair the user’s vision, allowing the user the chance to navigate through the world freely without caution.

Smartphone 360 Video 
While the Smartphone itself allows the use of 360 media, outside distractions can lessen the experience immensely. With the addition of a headset to the screen quality of a smart phone, the user is able to a view an extremely immersive experience, without hindering the users’ hands. The user can rotate his entire body to explore the displayed reality While immersive, many of the apps are pre-recorded and don’t allow for a dynamic experience.

VIVE
In my opinion, the VIVE allowed for the greatest quality of virtual reality with the devices sampled. The VIVE’s controller fit nicely within the hand and allowed for extremely responsive movements and functionality. The controller has several buttons and a touch pad, allowing the user to interact with objects precisely. Its greatest drawback is the long cord extending from the headset. This cord creates a serious tripping hazard which can be dangerous if not properly managed. For safety, the user is restricted to a small grid in which obstacles will be avoided.
